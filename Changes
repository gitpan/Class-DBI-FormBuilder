Revision history for Class-DBI-FormBuilder

0.3452 Sat  16 Jul, 2005 22:30
        - half fixed _db_order_columns bug. The internal lookup could die 
            for the 'All' group if this group was not set up explicitly. 
            Looks like Maypole (via CDBI::Loader?) normally does set this up 
            explicitly, but hand-rolled setups normally will not. The fix will 
            return the columns for the 'All' group (via CDBI->columns( 'All' ) 
            in non-db order if the group is not defined explicitly.
            Reported by dkamholz.
        - highlighted Class::DBI::Plugin::Type issue in GOTCHAS (reported by dkamholz)
        - add 'our $pager' declaration to pager template (reported by dkamholz)

        - removed restriction on setting keepextras to 1

0.345  Thur 14 Jul, 2005 10:00
        - only add pk fields to forms built for objects, not for 
            classes or searches. Empty pk hidden fields were being submitted 
            as empty strings rather than undef in some situations.
        - renamed form_hidden() to form_pks()    

0.3441 Wed  13 Jul, 2005 23:10
        - an extra test

0.344  Wed  13 Jul, 2005 23:00
        - don't send undefs to create() for columns not represented in form data

0.343  Wed  13 Jul, 2005 13:24
        - previous fix was broken if caller tries to set keepextras to 1. Now 
            we just croak, the proper fix is to remove pks from validation, or 
            figure out what fields are required and set that explicitly.

0.342  Wed  13 Jul, 2005 10:45
        - fixed bug where keepextras set by caller were overridden in _get_args
            (reported by David Kamholz)
        - added big warning about as_form_with_related to pod.
