# C::FB sometimes gets confused when passed CDBI::Column objects as field names, 
# hence all the map {''.$_} column filters. Some of them are probably unnecessary, 
# but I need to track down which. UPDATE: the dev version now uses map { $_->name }
# everywhere.

# CDBI has accessor_name *and* mutator_name methods, so potentially, each column could 
# have 2 methods to get/set its values, neither of which are the column's name.

# Column objects can be queried for these method names: $col->accessor and $col->mutator

# Not sure yet what to do about caller-supplied column names. 

# General strategy: don't stringify anything until sending stuff to CGI::FB, at which point:
#   1. stringify all values
#   2. test field names to see if they are (CDBI column) objects, and if so, extract the 
#       appropriate accessor or mutator name

# UPDATE: forms should be built with $column->name as the field name, because in general 
#   form submissions will need to do both get and set operations. So the form handling 
#   methods should assume forms supply column names, and should look up column mutator/accessor 
#   as appropriate.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Errata: use of column name/accessor/mutator is currently broken if your column 
accessors/mutators are different from the column name>. The documentation is also broken w.r.t. this. 

This module creates a L<CGI::FormBuilder|CGI::FormBuilder> form from a CDBI class or object. If 
from an object, it populates the form fields with the object's values. 

Column metadata and CDBI relationships are analyzed and the fields of the form are modified accordingly. 
For instance, MySQL C<enum> and C<set> columns are configured as C<select>, C<radiobutton> or 
C<checkbox> widgets as appropriate, and appropriate widgets are built for C<has_a>, C<has_many> 
and C<might_have> relationships. Further relationships can be added by subclassing. C<has_a> columns 
are set as 'required' fields in create/update forms.

A demonstration app (using L<Maypole::FormBuilder|Maypole::FormBuilder>) can be viewed at 

    http://beerfb.riverside-cms.co.uk
    
=head1 Customising field construction

Often, the default behaviour will be unsuitable. For instance, a C<has_a> relationship might point to 
a related table with thousands of records. A popup widget with all these records is probably not useful.  
Also, it will take a long time to build, so post-processing the form to re-design the field is a 
poor solution. 

Instead, you can pass an extra C<process_fields> argument in the call to C<as_form> (or you can 
set it in C<form_builder_defaults>).

Many of the internal routines use this mechanism for configuring fields. A manually set '+' 
(basic) processor will be B<added> to any other automatic processing, whereas a manually set shortcut 
processor (no '+') will B<replace> all automatic processing. 

You can add your own processors to the internal table of processors - see C<new_field_processor>.

=head2 process_fields

This is a hashref, with keys being field names. Values can be:

=over 4

=item Name of a built-in

    basic             shortcut
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    +HIDDEN           HIDDEN            make the field hidden
    +VALUE            VALUE             display the current value
    +READONLY         READONLY          display the current value - not editable
    +DISABLED         DISABLED          display the current value - not editable, not selectable, (not submitted?)
    +FILE             FILE              build a file upload widget
    +OPTIONS_FROM_DB  OPTIONS_FROM_DB   check if the column is constrained to a few values
    +REQUIRED                           make the field required
    +NULL                               no-op - useful for debugging
    +ADD_FIELD                          add a new field to the form (only necessary if the field is empty)
                      TIMESTAMP         used to process TIMESTAMP fields, defaults to DISABLED, but you can 
                                            easily replace it with a different behaviour
    +SET_VALUE($value)                  set the value of the field to $value - DEPRECATED - use +SET_value
    +SET_$foo($value) SET_$foo($value)  set the $foo attribute of the field to $value 
    
The 'basic' versions apply only their own modification. The 'shortcut' version also applies 
the C<+VALUE> processor. 
    
C<OPTIONS_FROM_DB> currently only supports MySQL ENUM or SET columns. You probably won't need to use 
this explicitly, as it's already used internally. 

The C<+ADD_FIELD> processor is only necessary if you need to add a new field to a form, but don't want to 
use any of the other processors on it. 

=item Reference to a subroutine, or anonymous coderef

The coderef will be passed the L<Class::DBI::FormBuilder> class or subclass, the CDBI class or 
object, the L<CGI::FormBuilder> form object, and the field name as arguments, and should build the 
named field. 

=item Package name 

Name of a package with a suitable C<field> subroutine. Gets called with the same arguments as 
the coderef.

=item Arrayref of the above

Applies each processor in order. 

=back

The key C<__FINAL__> is reserved for C<form_final>, so don't name any form fields C<__FINAL__>. If a 
field processor is set in C<__FINAL__>, then it will be applied to all fields, after all other 
processors have run. 

=head1 Customising C<render> output

C<Class::DBI::FormBuilder> replaces C<CGI::FormBuilder::render()> with a hookable version of C<render()>.
The hook is a coderef, or the name of a built-in, supplied in the C<post_process> argument (which can 
be set in the call to C<as_form>, C<search_form>, C<render>, or in C<form_builder_defaults>). The coderef 
is passed the following arguments:

    $class      the CDBI::FormBuilder class or subclass
    $form       the CGI::FormBuilder form object
    $render     reference to &CGI::FormBuilder::render
    $pp_args    value of the post_process_args argument, or undef
    %args       the arguments used in the CGI::FormBuilder->new call

The coderef should return HTML markup for the form, probably by calling C<< $render->( $form, %args ) >>. 

=over 4

=item PrettyPrint

A pretty-printer coderef is available in the hashref of built-in post-processors: 

    my $pretty = Class::DBI::FormBuilder->post_processors->{PrettyPrint};
    
So you can turn on pretty printing for a class by setting:

    My::Class->form_builder_defaults->{post_process} = Class::DBI::FormBuilder->post_processors->{PrettyPrint};
    
=item NoTextAreas

This post-processor ensures that any fields configured as C<textarea>s are converted to a plain C<text> 
field before rendering. 

This might have been used for instance in the L<Maypole::FormBuilder> editable 
C<list> template, to ensure each form in the table fits neatly into a single row. Except that method is 
an ugly hack that doesn't support post-processors.

=back
    
=head1 Plugins

C<has_a> relationships can refer to non-CDBI classes. In this case, C<form_has_a> will attempt to 
load (via C<require>) an appropriate plugin. For instance, for a C<Time::Piece> column, it will attempt 
to load L<Class::DBI::FormBuilder::Plugin::Time::Piece>. Then it will call the C<field> method in the plugin, 
passing the CDBI class for whom the form has been constructed, the form, and a L<Class::DBI::Column> object 
representing the field being processed. The plugin can use this information to modify the form, perhaps 
adding extra fields, or controlling stringification, or setting up custom validation. Note that the name of 
the form field should be retrieved from the field object as C<< $field->name >>, rather than relying 
on C< $field > to stringify itself, because it will stringify to C<< $field->name_lc >>.

If no plugin is found, a fatal exception is thrown. If you have a situation where it would be useful to 
simply stringify the object instead, let me know and I'll make this configurable.

=head1 Automatic validation setup

If you place a normal L<CGI::FormBuilder|CGI::FormBuilder> validation spec in the C<validate> argument,
that spec will be used to configure validation. 

If there is no spec in the method call or in C<< $class->form_builder_defaults->{validate} >>, then 
validation will be configured automatically. The default configuration is pretty basic, but you can modify it 
by placing settings in the C<auto_validate> argument, or in C<< $class->form_builder_defaults->{auto_validate} >>. 

=head2 Basic auto-validation

Given no validation options for a column in the C<auto_validate> slot, the settings for most columns 
will be taken from C<%Class::DBI::FormBuilder::ValidMap>. This maps SQL column types to the L<CGI::FormBuilder|CGI::FormBuilder> validation settings C<VALUE>, C<INT>, or C<NUM>. 

MySQL C<ENUM> or C<SET> columns will be set up to validate that the submitted value(s) match the allowed 
values. 

Any column listed in C<< $class->form_builder_defaults->{options} >> will be set to validate those values. 

=head2 Advanced auto-validation

The following settings can be placed in the C<auto_validate> argument (or in 
C<< $class->form_builder_defaults->{auto_validate} >>).

=over 4

=item validate

Specify validate types for specific columns:

    validate => { username   => [qw(nate jim bob)],
                  first_name => '/^\w+$/',    # note the 
                  last_name  => '/^\w+$/',    # single quotes!
                  email      => 'EMAIL',
                  password   => \&check_password,
                  confirm_password => {
                      javascript => '== form.password.value',
                      perl       => 'eq $form->field("password")'
                  }
                          
This option takes the same settings as the C<validate> option to C<CGI::FormBuilder::new()> 
(i.e. the same as would otherwise go in the C<validate> argument or in 
C<< $class->form_builder_defaults->{validate} >>). Settings here override any others. 

=item columns

Alias for C<validate>. Don't use both, they're not intended to be merged. Use whichever 
feels more comfortable. If you're used to using L<CGI::FormBuilder>, it may feel more 
natural to use C<validate>. If not, it may make more sense to use C<columns>.

=item skip_columns

List of columns that will not be validated:

    skip_columns => [ qw( secret_stuff internal_data ) ]

=item match_columns

Use regular expressions matching groups of columns to specify validation:

    match_columns => { qr/(^(widget|burger)_size$/ => [ qw( small medium large ) ],
                       qr/^count_.+$/             => 'INT',
                       }
                       
=item validate_types

Validate according to SQL data types:

    validate_types => { date => \&my_date_checker,
                        }
                       
Defaults are taken from the package global C<%TypesMap>. 
                        
=item match_types

Use a regular expression to map SQL data types to validation types:

    match_types => { qr(date) => \&my_date_checker,
                     }
                     
=item debug
    
Control how much detail to report (via C<warn>) during setup. Set to 1 for brief 
info, and 2 for a list of each column's validation setting.

=item strict

If set to 1, will die if a validation setting cannot be determined for any column. 
Default is to issue warnings and not validate these column(s).

=back
    
=head2 Validating relationships

Although it would be possible to retrieve the IDs of all objects for a related column and use these to 
set up validation, this would rapidly become unwieldy for larger tables. Default validation will probably be 
acceptable in most cases, as the column type will usually be some kind of integer. 

=over 4

=item timestamp

The default behaviour is to skip validating C<timestamp> columns. A warning will be issued
if the C<debug> parameter is set to 2.

Note that C<timestamp> columns are rendered as C<readonly> (see C<form_timestamp>). 

=item Failures

The default mapping of column types to validation types is set in C<%Class::DBI::FormBulder::ValidMap>, 
and is probably incomplete. If you come across any failures, you can add suitable entries to the hash before calling C<as_form>. However, B<please> email me with any failures so the hash can be updated for everyone.

=head1 Other features

=over 4

=item Class::DBI::FromForm

If you want to use this module alongside L<Class::DBI::FromForm|Class::DBI::FromForm>, 
load the module like so

    use Class::DBI::FormBuilder BePoliteToFromForm => 1;
    
and C<create_from_form> and C<update_from_form> will instead be imported as C<create_from_fb> and C<update_from_fb>.

You might want to do this if you have more complex validation requirements than L<CGI::FormBuilder|CGI::FormBuilder> provides. 
    
=back

=head1 METHODS

Most of the methods described here are exported into the caller's namespace, except for the form modifiers 
(see below), and a few others as documented. 

=over 4

=item new_field_processor( $processor_name, $coderef or package name )

This method is called on C<Class::DBI::FormBuilder> or a subclass, rather than on a L<Class::DBI> 
object or subclass. 

It installs a new field processor, which can then be referred to by name in C<process_fields>, 
rather than by passing a coderef. This method could also be used to replace the supplied built-in 
field processors, for example to alter the default C<TIMESTAMP> behaviour (see C<form_timestamp>). 
The new processor must either be a coderef, or the name of a package with a 
suitable C<field> method, or the name of another processor, or an arrayref of any of these.

The code ref will be passed these arguments: 

    position    argument
    --------------------
       0        name of the calling class (i.e. Class::DBI::FormBuilder or a subclass)
       1        Class::DBI object or class name
       2        CGI::FormBuilder form object
       3        name of the current field
       4        Class::DBI::Column object for the current field
     
The name of the current field is the name used on the form object, and is also the B<mutator> accessor 
for the column on the CDBI object (which defaults to the name in the database, but can be different). 

The column object is useful if the processor needs access to the value in the CDBI object, but the 
mutator name is different from the column accessor e.g. see the C<+VALUE> processor.

=item table_meta( $them )

L<Class::DBI::FormBuilder> class method.

Returns a L<Class::DBI::FormBuilder::Meta::Table> object.

sub table_meta
{
    my ( $me, $them ) = @_;
    
    return Class::DBI::FormBuilder::Meta::Table->instance( $them );
}

=item column_meta( $them, $column, $key )

DEPRECATED. Query the C<table_meta> object instead.

L<Class::DBI::FormBuilder> class method.

Returns information about the specified column or columns. 

C<$column> must either be the B<mutator> accessor to the column, or a L<Class::DBI::Column> object. The 
mutator accessor defaults to the column name, unless your class has a C<mutator_name> method. 

C<$column> can also be an arrayref of the above. 

The following keys are available:

    order           # ordinal position of the column in the database
    type            # column type 
    
    # these return '1' and 'yes' for typeless databases (SQLite):
    nullable        # 0 => no, 1 => yes, 2 => unknown
    is_nullable     # no, yes, ''
    
    # these return undef for typeless databases (SQLite):
    default         # default value of the column
    size    
    digits
    
    # MySQL:
    mysql_values    
    mysql_type_name
    
For typeless databases (SQLite), C<type> returns whatever string the type was set to in the schema - so 
you might see things like C<VARCHAR>, C<varchar>, C<varchar(255)> or C<VARCHAR(255)> etc.

Otherwise C<type> is the uppercase SQL type, i.e. C<VARCHAR> etc.

=item column_type( $them, $col )

DEPRECATED. Query the C<table_meta> object instead.

Provides consistent output when using C<column_meta> to query a column's type. 

C<$column> must either be the B<mutator> accessor to the column, or a L<Class::DBI::Column> object. 

Returns the type in lower case, with supefluous bits chopped off. So C<VARCHAR(255)> is returned 
as C<varchar>.

For C<has_many> and similar (e.g. C<might_have>) relationships, returns the type of the column in 
the related class.

=item form_builder_defaults( %args )

Stores default arguments.  

=item as_form( %args )

Builds a L<CGI::FormBuilder|CGI::FormBuilder> form representing the class or object. 

Takes default arguments from C<form_builder_defaults>. 

The optional hash of arguments is the same as for C<CGI::FormBuilder::new()>, with a few extras, 
and will override any keys in C<form_builder_defaults>. 

The extra keys are documented in various places in this file - I'll gather them together here 
over time. Extra keys include:

=over 4

=item options_sorters

A hashref, keyed by field name, with values being coderefs that will be used to sort the list 
of options generated for a C<has_a>, C<has_many>, or C<might_have> field. 

The coderef will be passed pairs of options arrayrefs, and should return the standard Perl sort 
codes (i.e. -1, 0, or 1). The first item in each arrayref is the value of the option, the second 
is the label.

Note that the coderef should be prototyped ($$):

    # sort by label, alphabetically
    $field_name => sub ($$) { $_[0]->[1] cmp $_[1]->[1] }

    # sort by value, numerically
    $field_name => sub ($$) { $_[0]->[0] <=> $_[1]->[0] }

=back

Note that parameter merging is likely to become more sophisticated in future releases 
(probably copying the argument merging code from L<CGI::FormBuilder|CGI::FormBuilder> 
itself).

=item search_form( %args )

Build a form with inputs that can be fed to search methods (e.g. C<search_where_from_form>). 
For instance, all selects are multiple, fields that normally would be required 
are not, and C<TEXT> columns are represented as C<text> fields rather than as C<textarea>s by default.

B<Automatic configuration of validation settings is not carried out on search forms>. You can 
still configure validation settings using the standard L<CGI::FormBuilder> settings. 

In many cases, you will want to design your own search form, perhaps only searching 
on a subset of the available columns. Note that you can acheive that by specifying 

    fields => [ qw( only these fields ) ]
    
in the args. 

The following search options are available. They are only relevant if processing 
via C<search_where_from_form>.

=over 4

=item search_opt_cmp

Allow the user to select a comparison operator by passing an arrayref:

    search_opt_cmp => [ ( '=', '!=', '<', '<=', '>', '>=', 
                          'LIKE', 'NOT LIKE', 'REGEXP', 'NOT REGEXP',
                          'REGEXP BINARY', 'NOT REGEXP BINARY',
                          ) ]
    

Or, transparently set the search operator in a hidden field:

    search_opt_cmp => 'LIKE'
    
=item search_opt_order_by

If true, will generate a widget to select (possibly multiple) columns to order the results by, 
with an C<ASC> and C<DESC> option for each column.

If set to an arrayref, will use that to build the widget. 

    # order by any columns
    search_opt_order_by => 1
    
    # or just offer a few
    search_opt_order_by => [ 'foo', 'foo DESC', 'bar' ]

=begin notes

There seem to be several ways to approach this:

1. Modify the original args, so that CGI::FB builds a single form with multiple sets of inputs. 
    This seems difficult, but would result in a form that could be processed very easily.
    
2. Build multiple forms, and use a custom javascript submit button to gather all their inputs and 
    submit a single form. The js is tricky, and processing the input is not easy, because we don't 
    have a server form to handle it.
    
3. Use HTML::Tree to build a super-form from a standard form. Same problem with processing input as 
    for #2.
    
4. AJAX - instead of submitting all forms in one go (as in #2), submit each form individually. This 
    would solve the problem of processing the submission, but requires a different architecture.  

Seems to boil down to #1 or #3. 

The problem with #1 is that after building the CGI::FB form, it is then passed through all the form 
modifiers, including any registered field processors. All of this would have to cope with modifying 
field names. But maybe that could be done via a final field modifier?

The problem with #3 is processing submissions, since the final form is never represented by a CGI::FB
form. 

UPDATE: the solution is:

5. Build the individual forms, tweak their field names, then combine all the fields
    from all the forms into a single form. This works because most of the CGI::FB magic 
    does not happen during form construction, but during calls made on the completed form.

=item as_multiform

This method supports adding multiple related items to an object in a related class. Call this method 
on the class at the 'many' end of a C<has_many> relationship. Instead of building a form with fields 

    foo 
    bar
    baz
    
it builds a form with fields

    R1__foo
    R1__bar
    R1__baz
    R2__foo
    R2__bar
    R2__baz
    etc.
    
Specify the number of duplicates in the C<how_many> required argument.

Use C<create_from_multiform> to process a form submission.
    
See C<Maypole::FormBuilder::Model::addmany()> and the C<addmany> template for example usage.

=item as_form_with_related

B<DEPRECATED>.

B<This method is NOT WORKING, and will be removed from a future version>. The plan is to replace C<as_form> 
with this code, when it's working properly. 

Builds a form with fields from the target CDBI class/object, plus fields from the related objects. 

Accepts the same arguments as C<as_form>, with these additions:

=over 4

=item related

A hashref of C<< $field_name => $as_form_args_hashref >> settings. Each C<$as_form_args_hashref> 
can take all the same settings as C<as_form>. These are used for generating the fields of the class or 
object(s) referred to by that field. For instance, you could use this to only display a subset of the 
fields of the related class. 

=item show_related

By default, all related fields are shown in the form. To only expand selected related fields, list 
them in C<show_related>.

=head2 Form modifiers

These methods use CDBI's knowledge about its columns and table relationships to tweak the 
form to better represent a CDBI object or class. They can be overridden if you have better 
knowledge than CDBI does. For instance, C<form_options> only knows how to figure out 
select-type columns for MySQL databases. 

You can handle new relationship types by subclassing, and writing suitable C<form_*> methods (e.g. 
C<form_many_many)>. Your custom methods will be automatically called on the relevant fields. 

C<has_a> relationships to non-CDBI classes are handled via a plugin mechanism (see above). 

=over 4

=item form_hidden

Deprecated. Renamed C<form_pks>.

=item form_pks

Ensures primary column fields are included in the form (even if they were not included in the 
C<fields> list), and hides them. Only forms representing objects will have primary column fields added.

=cut

        $me->_process_field( $them, $form, $field, $process );
    }
}

=item form_options

Identifies column types that should be represented as select, radiobutton or 
checkbox widgets. Currently only works for MySQL C<ENUM> and C<SET> columns. 

Patches are welcome for similar column types in other RDBMS's. 

Note that you can easily emulate a MySQL C<ENUM> column at the application level by setting 
the validation for the column to an arrayref of values. Emulate a C<SET> column by additionally 
setting the C<multiple> option to C<1>.

        $me->_process_field( $them, $form, $field, $process );
    }    
}

=item form_has_a

Populates a select-type widget with entries representing related objects. Makes the field 
required.

Note that this list will be very long if there are lots of rows in the related table. 
You may need to override this behaviour by setting up a pre-processor for your C<has_a> fields. See
'Customising field construction'.

This method assumes the primary key is a single column - patches welcome. 

Retrieves every row and creates an object for it - not good for large tables.

If the relationship is to a non-CDBI class, loads a plugin to handle the field (see 'Plugins').

=item form_timestamp

Makes timestamp columns read only, since they will be set by the database.

The default is to use the C<TIMESTAMP> processor, which in turn points to the C<READONLY> 
processor, which sets the HTML C<readonly> attribute. 

If you prefer, you can replace the C<TIMESTAMP> processor with one that points to C<DISABLED> instead.

=item form_file

B<Unimplemented> - at the moment, you need to set the field type to C<file> manually, or 
in the C<process_fields> argument, set the field processor to C<FILE>.

Figures out if a column contains file data. 

If somebody can show me how to automatically detect that a column stores binary data, then this method 
could actually do something useful. 

If you are in the habit of using a naming convention that allows you to identify C<file> columns, then 
you could subclass L<Class::DBI::FormBuilder> and override this method:

    # use a naming convention to configure file columns
    sub form_file
    {
        my ( $me, $them, $form, $pre_process ) = @_;
    
        foreach my $field ( $them->columns( 'All' ) )

=item form_process_extras

This processor adds any fields in the C<process_fields> setup that do not yet exist on the form. 
This is a useful method for adding custom fields (i.e. fields that do not represent anything about 
the CDBI object) to a form. 

You can skip this stage by setting C<< process_fields->{__SKIP_PROCESS_EXTRAS__} >> to a true 
value. For instance, in C<Maypole::FormBuilder::Model::setup_form_mode()>, this prevents any fields 
already present in C<process_fields> (e.g. because they were specified in C<form_builder_defaults>) 
from being added to the button form.

    }    
}

=item form_final

After running all previous field processors (including C<form_process_extras>), this gives the 
chance to run code to modify all fields in the completed form. Use this by setting a field 
processor in the special C<__FINAL__> slot of C<process_fields>.

And avoid naming any of your normal columns or fields C<__FINAL__>.

=head2 Form handling methods

All these methods check the form like this

    return unless $fb->submitted && $fb->validate;
    
which allows you to say things like

    print Film->update_from_form( $form ) ? $form->confirm : $form->render;
    
That's pretty concise!

# Also, this patch only applies to many-many.  Not one-many.  I got to

# for one-many with existing records..  Because if you edit a record and
# select a record to relate to it..  The related record may already be
# associated with a separate record, and it would kill that association..
# Not intuitive.  But for many-many, I don't see the downside of having
# something like this be standard.  The only thing I can think of is, what
# if the glue table has additional columns besides the two foreign keys?
# I can't think of an example right now, but I guess it's possible.  The
# other thing I don't quite understand is why
# meta_info->field->args->mapping is an array and not a scalar.  I just
# pull off the first element, but I don't know whether it's possible that
# there be more elements than that, and what they mean.

built using C<search_form> (not C<as_form>). Otherwise the form may fail validation checks 
because of missing required fields specified by C<as_form> (C<search_form> does not automatically

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- / validation -----

=head1 TODO

has_many fields are not currently being validated (the code to set up the validation config 
was choking on has_many columns, so for now, they're ignored).

Use the proper column accessors (i.e. $column->name for form field names, $column->accessor 
for 'get', and $column->mutator foe 'set' operations).

Add support for local plugins - i.e. specify a custom namespace to search for plugins, before 
searching the CDBI::FB::Plugin namespace.

Better merging of attributes. For instance, it'd be nice to set some field attributes 
(e.g. size or type) in C<form_builder_defaults>, and not lose them when the fields list is 
generated and added to C<%args>. 

Regex and column type entries for C<process_fields>, analogous to validation settings.

Use preprocessors in form_has_a, form_has_many and form_might_have.

Transaction support - see http://search.cpan.org/~tmtm/Class-DBI-0.96/lib/Class/DBI.pm#TRANSACTIONS
and http://wiki.class-dbi.com/index.cgi?AtomicUpdates

Wrap the call to C<$form_modify> in an eval, and provide a better diagnostic if the call 
fails because it's trying to handle a relationship that has not yet been coded - e.g. is_a

Store CDBI errors somewhere on the form. For instance, if C<update_from_form> fails because 
no object could be retrieved using the form data. 

Detect binary data and build a file upload widget. 

C<is_a> relationships.

C<enum> and C<set> equivalent column types in other dbs.

Figure out how to build a form for a related column when starting from a class, not an object
(pointed out by Peter Speltz). E.g. 

   my $related = $object->some_col;

   print $related->as_form->render;
   
will not work if $object is a class. Have a look at Maypole::Model::CDBI::related_class. 

Integrate fields from a related class object into the same form (e.g. show address fields 
in a person form, where person has_a address). B<UPDATE>: fairly well along in 0.32 (C<as_form_with_related>).
B<UPDATE>: as_form_with_related() is deprecated (and still not working) Once it works properly, it 
will be merged into C<as_form>. 

C<_splice_form> needs to handle custom setup for more relationship types.

=head1 BUGS

If no fields are explicitly required, then *all* fields will become required automatically, because 
CGI::FormBuilder by default makes any field with validation become required, unless there is at least 
1 field specified as required. 

Please report any bugs or feature requests to
C<bug-class-dbi-plugin-formbuilder@rt.cpan.org>, or through the web interface at
L<http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/ReportBug.html?Queue=Class-DBI-FormBuilder>.
I will be notified, and then you'll automatically be notified of progress on
your bug as I make changes.

Looking at the code (0.32), I suspect updates to has_many accessors are not implemented, since the update
methods only fetch data for columns( 'All' ), which doesn't include has_many accessors/mutators.
